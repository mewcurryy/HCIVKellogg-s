                        <h2>Founding and Early Years</h2>
                        <p>VKellogg's was founded by Will Keith Kellogg in 1906 in Battle Creek, Michigan, United States. Initially, the company focused on producing breakfast cereals, a novel concept at the time. Will Keith Kellogg, inspired by his brother's work at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, developed the flaked cereal that would become the company's first major product. This innovation laid the foundation for VKellogg's enduring legacy in the breakfast food industry.</p>
